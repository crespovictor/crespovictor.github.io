about: I am a Masters Student at the School of Cybernetics in the Australian National University where I study safe, sustainable, and responsible use of AI-enabled systems (Cyber-Physical Systems). Before moving to Australia, I was working in the Latin American start-up space in financial technology solutions. I like to always challenge what I know. As an engineer, part of my job is to understand how things work and how they can be improved.
