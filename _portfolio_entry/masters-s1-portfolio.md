# Learning portfolio
In this website (Which I built from scratch) I document my journey through the course “Building Cyber-Physical Systems”, with emphasis on the skills I have developed and those that I’d like to further experiment. With the ongoing adoption of artificial intelligence, the internet of things, 5G networks, and other technologies, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) will become everyday systems. This creates new challenges that practitioners of the New Branch of Engineering (NBE) are starting to face. Such challenges and the way that those practitioners approach to resolve them will enable CPS to scale in a safe manner. Keep scrolling and click on each section. It will open a different page to take a look at it.
