# About Me

Hi, I'm Victor Crespo-Rodriguez [<i class="fa-solid fa-volume-high"></i>](https://tophonetics.com/pronounce/zW4vGRQGGZ5yRqEOcKJifhzlBJ9a4UAnKwMLF7EgRg/){:target="_blank"}

I’m a Melbourne-based PhD student developing new ways to test AI systems, with a focus on autonomous vehicles. A curious mind, tech explorer, and sci-fi enthusiast, I’m passionate about innovation and the future of privacy.

When I’m not deep in code or research, you’ll find me gaming, clashing in trading card battles, organizing the occasional event, or hunting for the perfect shot through my camera lens.

# Interests
I’m endlessly curious about technology, science, and science fiction, always chasing the thrill of learning something new. I thrive on exploring fresh ideas, experimenting with cutting-edge innovations, and staying ahead of the curve in tech. I’m equally drawn to the big questions—digital ethics, data sovereignty, and the future of privacy.

In my downtime, I love tinkering with my self-hosted server, experimenting with new software stacks, and finding creative ways to automate life’s little annoyances. My current side project? Building an automated mini-greenhouse for my herbs and veggies <i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i>
