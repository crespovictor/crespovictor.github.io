A journey of experimenting, discovering, and messing around to learn JavaScript.

### Hello Javascript!

This is a series of blog post covering my journey in self-learning Javascript.

I have to say that I've never liked Java or Javascript and I prefer interpreted and/or imperative programming languages, such as Python and Ruby (I built this website using Jekyll and Ruby), but I decided to give a go tryign to learn Javascript and document my journey here.

## Javascript meets HTML
[Javascript][1] is a programming language primarily used for client-side scripting on Web, although lately it's becoming also an alternative for developing server-side applications using [node.js][2]. Javascript is so important because aproximately 97% of all websites use Javascript for web page behaviour.

## What I want to learn
- [ ] Data Visualisations (i.e. D3.js)
- [ ] node.js
- [ ] Videogames or similar in Javascript
- [ ] Mobile-first websites and/or applications (React, etc)
- [ ] Art focused frameworks such as P5

## What is my plan?
I will develop a training plan, from the basics of JavaScript to probably running server-side applications (node.js), but I will focus more on data visualisations and videogames.

## In conclusion
Let's JavaScript
