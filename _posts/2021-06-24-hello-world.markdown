This is my Nth attempt at making a blog from scratch (and maintaining it once it's running). In this blog I will write about projects, either small or not so small, that I do to learn new things and document the process. I plan to include software, hardware, as well as previous projects that I worked on during my studies, and some other things that I encounter in the process. 

This time I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] to create the blog engine, and hosting it on [Github Pages][githubpages]. 

I'm using the [Fluent Design][fluent] guidelines by Microsoft, to do the visual style of the website, using [Bootstrap][bootstrap] to guide the design process.


### To-Do
- [ ] - Add a funny 404 page with a Tardis flying (Just because I like Doctor Who). *You're lost in time and space*
- [x] - Add meta tags to track unique visitors
