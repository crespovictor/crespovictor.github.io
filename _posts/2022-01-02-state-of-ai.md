In this report we focus on the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by organisations in Australia. It is a starting point and a snapshot to understand the current state of adoption, as well as drivers and challenges that organisations encounter during this process. Further research would be needed to grasp a complete understanding of adoption of AI, including other AI techniques such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, and others.


## Overview
Adoption of AI has the potential to generate benefits across the economy, allowing for the same product or service to be delivered for less and be better tailored for consumers’ needs, as stated by the Australian Government.8 To ensure that Australian organisations achieve the full benefit of AI and digital innovation, we will need to better understand and develop a new perspective of digital success. For many organisations this will mean accelerating their digital transformation journey, whilst for others this will mean further building the right environment for effective adoption, upskilling people, and improving top management support. Working together, AI developers and organisations can develop actions that will result in increasing the AI-readiness and the adoption of AI by organisations.
