## Abstract

Before being deployed on roads, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) must undergo comprehensive testing. Safety-critical situations, however, are infrequent in usual driving conditions, so simulated scenarios are used to create them. A test scenario comprises static and dynamic features related to the AV and the test environment; the representation of these features is complex and makes testing a heavy process. A test scenario is effective if it identifies incorrect behaviors of the AV. In this article, we present a technique for identifying key features of test scenarios associated with their effectiveness using Instance Space Analysis (ISA). ISA generates a (2D) representation of test scenarios and their features. This visualization helps to identify combinations of features that make a test scenario effective. We present a graphical representation of each feature that helps identify how well each testing technique explores the search space. While identifying key features is a primary goal, this study specifically seeks to determine the critical features that differentiate the performance of algorithms. Finally, we present metrics to assess the robustness of testing algorithms and the scenarios generated. Collecting essential features in combination with their values associated with effectiveness can be used for selection and prioritization of effective test cases.
